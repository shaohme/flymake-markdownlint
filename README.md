# flymake-markdownlint

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Project has moved to [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/shaohme/flymake-markdownlint)

A Flymake backend for validating Markdown files for Emacs (27+), using
[markdownlint-cli](https://github.com/igorshubovych/markdownlint-cli)

## Installation

`flymake-markdownlint` is not available on MELPA, so you have to add
it using your `load-path` manually.

## Usage

Add the following to your `.emacs` files for Emacs to load the backend
when visiting a Markdown file

```elisp
(require 'flymake-markdownlint)

(add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook 'flymake-markdownlint-setup)
```

Remember to enable `flymake-mode` as well, preferably after.
